New To Github, following this exercise.</Br>
I just finished VBA application (the Comic sans of programming languages someone said on Stack Overflow!)
because it is using previous council employer's db table which they use in Access 2013
So no choice at beginning other than to use VBA.. plus at beginning didn't realise VBA cannot use outside Access anyway.
but it had fair degree logical complexity in the end, given it is using just one SQL query with lots of fields in the end.
now just learning the features of github doing tutorial quickly.
Current plan to redo the VBA application in Python 2 with MySQL
because I'm learning Python 2 now,
though perhaps Javascript with Node.js might be faster.
I'm thinking once I did one reasonable Python app (this one),
go straight to learning Javascript and Node.js in detail,
as that is where commercial demand seems to be at my current junior level.
